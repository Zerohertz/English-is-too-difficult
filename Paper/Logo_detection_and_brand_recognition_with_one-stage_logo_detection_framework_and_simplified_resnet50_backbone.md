# [Logo detection and brand recognition with one-stage logo detection framework and simplified resnet50 backbone](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9144794)

> Similar to the framework proposed by Lin, Ai, & Doll [8], the `objective` of model training is to find model parameters that optimized Focal Loss (See Eq. 1) as the objective function.

+ Objective: 목적, 객관적인, 실재하는, 실증적인

> Interestingly, although each model `convergen` toward its optimum parameter values during training process, the average classification of loss and average regression of Model 2 outperforrmeds those of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, and Model 2 was faster than the other model, (see Figure 4).

+ Convergen: 수렴, 모이다 (Spanish)

> At this stage the testing was `carried out` by using seven models, which were in `accordance` to the models used in the previous process, which was in the training phase.

+ Carry out: 수행하다
+ Accordance: 일치, 합치, 조화, 인가, 수여

> The different frameworks proposed were frameworks in which the backbone is an `off-the-shelf` model.

+ Off-the-shelf: (특별히 디자인하거나 주문하지 않고) 규격품으로 (바로 살 수 있는)
