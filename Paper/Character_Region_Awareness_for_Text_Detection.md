# [Character Region Awareness for Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01941)

> To overcome the lack of individual character level annotations, our proposed framework `exploits` both the given character-level annotations for `synthetic` images and the estimated character-level ground-truths for real images acquired by the learned interim model.

+ Exploit: 이용하다, 위업, 착취하다
+ Synthetic: 합성한, 인조 물질, 종합적인

> Unlike a binary segmentation map, which labels each pixel `discretely`, we `encode` the probability of the character center with a Gaussian heatmap.

+ Discretely: 분리되어, 따로따로
+ Encode: 암호로 바꾸다, 부호화하다, 표현하다

> Since we have image `blobs` of word regions separated by CCL, the bounding box for a word is simply defined by the single `enclosing` rectangle.

+ Blob: (작은) 방울, (작은) 색깔 부분, 
+ Enclosing: (담, 울타리 등으로) 두르다 (둘러싸다), 에워 (둘러) 싸다, 동봉하다

> On a different note, our character linking process is `conducted` at a pixel-level, which differs from other linking-based methods [32, 12] relying on searching relations between text components `explicitly`.

+ Conduct: 하다, 행동, 경영
+ Explicitly: 명쾌하게

> The proposed method provides the character region score and the character `affinity` score that, together, fully cover various text shapes in a bottom-up `manner`.

+ Affinity: 친밀감, 관련성
+ Manner: 방식

> Since real datasets provided with character-level annotations are rare, we proposed a weakly-supervised learning method that generates `pseudo`-ground truthes from an `interim` model.

+ Pseudo: 허위의, 가짜의, 모조의
+ Interim: (영구적인 것이 나올 때까지 존속시키기 위한) 중간 (임시/과도)의
