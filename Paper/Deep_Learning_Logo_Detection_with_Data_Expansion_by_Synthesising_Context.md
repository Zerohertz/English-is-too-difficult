# [Deep Learning Logo Detection with Data Expansion by Synthesising Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09322)

> Logo detection in `unconstrained` images is challenging, particularly when only very `sparse` labelled training images are accessible due to high labelling costs

+ Unconstrained: 제한받지 않는
+ Sparse: 드문, 희박한

> In this work, we describe a model training image `synthesising` method `capable` of improving significantly logo detection performance when only a handful of (e.g., 10) labelled training images captured in realistic context are available, avoiding extensive manual labelling costs.

+ Synthesis: 종합, 합성
+ Capable: ~을 할 수 있는, 유능한

> Specifically, we design a novel algorithm for generating Synthetic Context Logo (SCL) training images to increase model robustness against unknown background `clutters`, resulting in superior logo detection performance

+ Clutter: 채우다, 잡동사니, 어수선함
