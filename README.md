## [PAN++: Towards Efficient and Accurate End-to-End Spotting of Arbitrarily-Shaped Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00405)

> PAN++ is based on the kernel representation that reformulates a text line as a text kernel (central region) surrounded by peripheral pixels.

+ Peripheral: 주변적인, 지엽적인, 주변부의

> By systematically comparing with existing scene text representations, we show that our kernel representation can not only describe arbitrarily-shaped text but also well distinguish adjacent text.

+ Arbitrarily: 임의적인
+ Distinguish: 구별하다, 구별 짓다
+ Adjacent: 인접한, 가까운
